his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
<span class="redtext">What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</span> <!--was not sure if the red text was bolded or not-->

<span class="redtext">"What moves me so deeply about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower-- the image 
of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span>
